  The following telemetry spans are emitted by bandit

  ## `[:bandit, :request, *]`

  Represents Bandit handling a specific client HTTP request

  This span is started by the following event:

  * `[:bandit, :request, :start]`

      Represents the start of the span

      This event contains the following measurements:

      * `monotonic_time`: The time of this event, in `:native` units

      This event contains the following metadata:

      * `telemetry_span_context`: A unique identifier for this span
      * `connection_telemetry_span_context`: The span context of the Thousand Island `:connection`
        span which contains this request

  This span is ended by the following event:

  * `[:bandit, :request, :stop]`

      Represents the end of the span

      This event contains the following measurements:

      * `monotonic_time`: The time of this event, in `:native` units
      * `duration`: The span duration, in `:native` units
      * `conn`: The `Plug.Conn` representing this connection
      * `req_header_end_time`: The time that header reading completed, in `:native` units
      * `req_body_start_time`: The time that request body reading started, in `:native` units.
      * `req_body_end_time`: The time that request body reading completed, in `:native` units
      * `req_line_bytes`: The length of the request line, in octets. Includes all line breaks.
        Not included for HTTP/2 requests
      * `req_header_bytes`: The length of the request headers, in octets. Includes all line
        breaks. Not included for HTTP/2 requests

        breaks. Not included for HTTP/2 requests
      * `resp_body_bytes`: The length of the reponse body, in octets. If the response is
        compressed, this is the size of the compressed payload as sent on the wire. Set to 0 for
        chunked responses
      * `resp_uncompressed_body_bytes`: The length of the original, uncompressed body. Only
        included for responses which are compressed
      * `resp_compression_method`: The method of compression, as sent in the `Content-Encoding`
        header of the response. Only included for responses which are compressed

      This event contains the following metadata:
