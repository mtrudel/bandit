defmodule Bandit.HTTP2.StreamTask do
  @moduledoc false
  # This Task is where an actual Plug is executed, within the context of an HTTP/2 stream. There
  # is a bit of split responsiblity between this module and the `Bandit.HTTP2.Adapter` module
  # which merits explanation:
  #
  # Broadly, this module is responsible for the execution of a Plug and does so within a Task
  # process. Task is used in preference to GenServer here because of the shape of the
  # `Plug.Conn.Adapter` API (implemented by the `Bandit.HTTP2.Adapter` module). Specifically, that
  # API requires blocking semantics for the `Plug.Conn.Adapter.read_req_body/2`) call and expects
  # it to block until some underlying condition has been met (the body has been read, a timeout
  # has occurred, etc). The events which 'unblock' these conditions typically come from within the
  # Connection, and are pushed down to streams as a fundamental design decision (rather than
  # having stream processes query the connection directly). As such, it is much simpler for Task
  # processes to wait in an imperative fashion using `receive` calls directly.
  #
  # To contain these design decisions, the 'connection-facing' API for sending data to a stream
  # process is expressed on this module (via the `recv_*` functions) even though the 'other half'
  # of those calls exists in the `Bandit.HTTP2.Adapter` module. As a result, this module and the
  # Handler module are fairly tightly coupled, but together they express clear APIs towards both
  # Plug applications and the rest of Bandit.
