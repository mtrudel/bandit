# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As Bandit is still in active development (its [major version is still 0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)), 
no formal support exists for any version earlier than the most recently released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security disclosures should be sent privately to mat@geeky.net.
